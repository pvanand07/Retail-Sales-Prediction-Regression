# Retail Sales Prediction - Rossmann Stores

In the fast-paced world of retail, having the ability to predict sales is of paramount importance. The project titled **Retail Sales Prediction** dives deep into the mechanics of predicting sales amounts for Rossmann Stores up to six weeks in advance.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Before diving into the models, it's crucial to understand the nuances of the dataset. Here are the key findings from the EDA:

1. **Seasonal Variation:** The sales data revealed that the business experiences a seasonal fluctuation, especially during the holiday season. This indicates a need for strategies to stimulate demand during non-peak seasons.
2. **Competition:** Areas with higher competition witnessed better sales. This insight can be used while selecting Store locations and where to focus marketing strategies.
3. **Promotions:** As expected, promotional periods give a substantial boost to sales. This underlines the importance of strategic planning around promotions.
4. **Store Type and Assortment:** Not all store types and assortments are made equal. Store type 'b' and assortment type 'c' lead the race in terms of sales.
5. **Sales Volume Trend:** A positive trend in sales volume indicates a growing business and a rising number of sales transactions. 

## 🧮 Model Implementation and Evaluation

The project employed a series of regression models, including Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and notably, the XGBoost Regression.

Model insights include:

1. In the preliminary model assessments, the **Random Forest Regressor** emerged as a frontrunner, registering an R-squared value of `0.88` on the validation set.
2. Subsequent hyperparameter optimization elevated the **XGBoost** model, which achieved an R-squared value of `0.94` on the validation set.
3. Notably, XGBoost consistently performed well, reflecting an R-squared value of `0.88` on the test data.

🔍 **Conclusion:** The comprehensive analysis and evaluation determined that the XGBoost Regression model is most adept at forecasting sales for Rossmann Stores.

## 🎉 Final Remarks

Through analysis and model evaluation, this project provides a robust predictive framework for retail sales. XGBoost Regression, in particular, has proven its efficacy, offering Rossmann Stores a potent tool for strategic planning and decision-making.
